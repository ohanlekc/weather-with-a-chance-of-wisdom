Project Requirements:

- My site allows you to input your location (CITY, STATE), and then supplies 
you with the weather in your area, as well as a quote that correlates with
the weather in your area. 
- There are different views for a laptop and phone using media queries.
- Two APIs are used:
    1. https://quotel-quotes.p.rapidapi.com/search/quotes
    2. https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/
- You can search your current location.
- Once the location is inputed, a display is loaded containing the precipitation,
temperature, cloud coverage, snow, and UV information, and then a quote is 
loaded based on your weather.
- Once everything is loaded, you can reload a new quote by clicking the 
button at the bottom of the screen.
